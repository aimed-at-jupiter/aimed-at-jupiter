### About me
Endlessly curious and self driven learner with a growing foundation in software development. Especially interested in exploring how complex systems and data can be leveraged to provide creative solutions to real-world problems.

I'm currently working mostly with JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, PSQL, React, HTML & CSS, but looking to explore TypeScript, Python and Java.


## Projects

### Film Club
<summary>Events platform for a community film meet up group that hosts discussions and screenings.</summary>
<details>
Users can browse all forthcoming events or filter by event type, and once logged in, can sign up for free events, pay for ticketed events using Stripe, and then optionally add them to their personal Google Calendar. Staff can create events auto populated with film info from the Open Movie Database (OMDb) simply by searching by film title, and optionally release year for more accurate results. The web app was built with accessibility in mind for use with screenreaders, and also securely handles user data with JWT and features protected endpoints for privacy and security.

### Interiyours
<summary>Intelligent room planning assistant that provides personalised furniture suggestions to meet your lifestyle needs, tailored to your specific room dimensions and budget.</summary>
<details>
Create a room by entering its dimensions, budget, and intended use. On submission, a real-time 3D rendering is generated, automatically populating the space with a suggested furniture layout based on your inputs. Furniture can be moved, rotated, removed, or replaced using items from a built-in catalogue. Multiple Rooms can be created, saved, and revisited later for further customisation. Each Room also includes a shareable view-only link.
